# Basic-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
- **To get started Image Classification with tensorflow I implemented basic neural network which classifies the image and predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy..**
- Created, trained and evaluated a neural network in TensorFlow.

- Following steps were performed in order to achieve the end results and improve the accuracy :
   - [x] Encoded the labels.
   - [x] Understood neural networks.
   - [x] Preprocessed image examples.
   - [x] Created a neural network model.
   - [x] Trained the model to fit the dataset.
   - [x] Evaluated the model.
   - [x] Visualized the predictions.
